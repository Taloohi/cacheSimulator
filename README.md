# cacheSimulator
Simulation of one level of cache performance, given a sample set of memory address traces (MATs). The configuration can be modified in order to determine the optimal configuration based on the MAT files, which are in ASCII. The memory of the system is 32 bits, where the parameters vary based on the associativity level, number of blocks and rows.
